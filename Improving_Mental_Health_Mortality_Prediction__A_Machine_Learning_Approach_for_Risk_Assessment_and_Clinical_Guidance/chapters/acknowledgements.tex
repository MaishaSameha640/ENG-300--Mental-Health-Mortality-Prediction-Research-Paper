\textbf{This is just a sample}

First of all I would like to thank the almighty ALLAH. Today I am successful in completing my work with such ease because He gave me the ability, chance, and cooperating supervisor.

I would like to take the opportunity to express my gratitude to Saifuddin Md. Tareeq, my respected supervisor. Although he was always loaded with several other activities, he gave me more than enough time in this work. He not only gave me time but also proper guidance and valuable advice whenever I faced with some difficulties. His comments and guidance helped me in preparing my thesis report.

I would like to thank Dr. Hafiz Md. Hasan Babu, my respected teacher, who inspired me in every step. I am also thankful to my teachers who helped me in a number of ways by providing various resources and moral support.

Last of all I am grateful to my family; who are, always with me in my every step of life.
